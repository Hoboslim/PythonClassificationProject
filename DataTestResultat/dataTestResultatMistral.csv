1. Some believe that Angels by Robbie Williams deserves to win due to its popularity and emotional impact on listeners. They also mention that it has united generations and will continue to be played for many years to come.

2. Others argue that Angels should not have won, as they consider it to be an overplayed and oversentimental song. Instead, they believe that either Joy Division or Queen should have received the award due to their influential roles in shaping modern music.

3. Some people find Angels irritating, while others enjoy Robbie Williams' music but think that this is not the best song of the last 25 years and view it as an example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye.

4. There are those who argue that the entire concept of determining the best song of the last 25 years is a pointless exercise, as most of the original choices were poor.

5. Some individuals think that this award should go to someone with genuine talent and not just popularity or commercial success. They believe that songs like Bohemian Rhapsody and Nothing Compares 2 U are more timeless and better choices for the award.

6. Lastly, some people feel indifferent towards Angels but acknowledge its nostalgia value, stating that it may have been a better choice than other options like Will Young's music.",4.1,False,,,,,,,,,
